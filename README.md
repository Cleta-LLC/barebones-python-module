# myapp

A fork-ready, microservice-friendly Python template.

Clone, init, test, run — then extend with your own services.

## Quickstart

```bash
just init       # install deps, create data dirs, check environment
just test       # run all tests
just run        # run the default service
```

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [just](https://github.com/casey/just). See `just doctor` for environment checks.

## What You Get

- **uv-native** workflows — `pyproject.toml` as single source of truth, `uv.lock` committed
- **Microservice architecture** — each service in `src/myapp/services/` with clear boundaries
- **Typed schemas** — Pydantic models at every boundary, versioned with `schema_version`
- **Dual persistence** — JSON (atomic file writes) + SQLite (WAL mode), independent by design
- **CLI** — Click-based, auto-discovers service commands (`project svc <name> <cmd>`)
- **Optional Streamlit UI** — wraps the same service APIs as the CLI
- **Quality gates** — ruff, mypy, pytest, all runnable via `just check`
- **CI** — GitHub Actions running the same gates with uv

## Documentation

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) | Get running in 3 commands |
| [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | Services, boundaries, data flow |
| [CLI Reference](docs/cli-reference.md) | All commands and options |
| [Persistence](docs/persistence.md) | JSON vs SQLite, no-sync explained |
| [Extending](docs/extending.md) | Add services, commands, schemas, UI pages |

## Adding a New Service

```bash
mkdir -p src/myapp/services/myservice/{storage,tests}
# Copy and adapt from services/example/
# The CLI auto-discovers it — no registration needed
project svc myservice --help
```
